					<span class="info"><p>
					Travis County has had over 1000 elected officials since 1840, and most of them have
					been men. In fact, no woman held office in the Travis County government until 1912. But, the county has progressed,
					and more and more women have been elected to
					office over the years. This exhibit highlights the trailblazers who
					made history by becoming the first woman to be elected to office. </p>
					<p>
					Listed below are the first women elected to Travis County Office. Click on the image to learn more about each official. </p></span>

								and avoid being taken to jail. This not only reduced the workload for her office, but it also allowed individuals to
								continue enjoying the Fourth of July festivities.
